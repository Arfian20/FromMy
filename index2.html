          Let’s look at some extensions for VS Code that make writing and editing HTML (and languages that are basically HTML with extra powers) better. You may not like all of them. Maybe some of them don’t appeal to you, solve a problem
          you don’t have, or feel like more clutter than you need. That’s OK. These are just a handful that I’ve tried and liked to some degree. I’d start with Emmet here, even thought it’s not technically an extension1 for VS Code. It’s
          built right in. You should know about it though because it’s very useful. It does “HTML Expansions” like this, which I use pretty much every day of my life:
        </p>
        <h2>HTML End Tag Labels</h2>
        <p class="p2">
          I heard about this one from Stefan Judis who blogged about it the other day and inspired this post idea. The whole idea is that rather than you leaving comments in your HTML to indicate what HTML element it is closing (a somewhat
          common practice, especially for partials that close elements that might not be opened in the same document).

        <h2>Auto Close Tag</h2>
        <p>As soon as you type the > in an HTML element, like the last bracket in <i>div</i>, the closing tag is automatically created for you.</p>
        <h2>Highlight Matching Tag</h2>
        <p>Here’s the GIF from their docs:</p>

        <p>
          I was going to do my own video, but I discovered that even if I have this extension off, something else in my VS Code is highlighting matching tags anyway. I’m not entirely sure what it is, which leads me to believe it might be a
          built-in feature now.
